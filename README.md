# SleepyTime

This is a small Python Script to calculate the cummulation and the breakdown of different substances used in the continuos Analgosedation of ICU Patients and visualize it using Matplotlib.

Right now all Strings are in german, if you slumbled upon this, and you are intrested in a version with english Strings let me know.


## ToDo's:
As of this point, this is still a work in progress.

__Things i want to add in the future:__
- [ ] Entry Fields to adjust mg/ml
- [ ] Distribution an reabsoption of the substance into the tissue
- [ ] Labels with the Dose at maximum cummulation and time until end of effect


## Disclaimer:
I have no formal training in programming. I hope to start a degree in medical informatics this summer, but right know i'm just an ICU Nurse who thaught himself some Python. If you find any mistakes in my code or you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know.
__I'm thankfull for any advice!__
